# newsBot
main.py will run the telegram bot @NewsSource_bot  
newstest.py is a test script to manually verify a given URL  
The FindLatest scripts are tailored scripts to scrape each respective news source  
The scripts in urlStuff are used to add new urls or clear them  
The urls file holds all urls, before adding one manually you could check if it can be scraped via newstest.py  
main.py will not post about bad urls, but they still might break something
