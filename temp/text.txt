In their celebrated book, What Happened To You? Conversations on Trauma, Resilience and Healing, Oprah Winfrey and psychiatrist Bruce D. Perry talk about “connectedness” being at the core of well-being. They introduce the idea that being part of a community and creating true emotional bonds helps people heal from the impact of deep trauma and deal with everyday stressors more effectively.
This takeaway is also supported by a 2017 study conducted among adults that found that community participation and mental well-being were positively related.
We are living in the post-Covid-19 world where building connections has become more important than ever before. People have transformed their lifestyles, sometimes with compromised mental health due to the myriad of experiences during the pandemic.
The macroeconomic trends have also created job-related insecurities. Families and communities are now experiencing new challenges as they live with the stress caused by looming uncertainty. People have been in survival mode for too long, thus increasing their hunger and need for social connectedness.
As employees are returning to work during such precarious times, some of the key trends shaping the global workforce today are managing distributed and skills-based teams, greater use of technology and automation and Millennials and Gen-Zs forming a large part of the workforce.
Deloitte’s 2023 Gen-Z and Millennial Survey, which interviewed around 22,000 people from 44 countries, found that today’s Gen-Z and Millennial employees feel the need to balance work lives with a drive for societal change (download required). They recognize the progress that has been made over the years but are expecting more. Nearly half of Gen-Zs and four in 10 Millennials said they feel stressed most of the time.
These trends look similar in the overall workforce as well. Gallup's "State of the Global Workplace Report: 2023" found that 56% of disengaged employees (download required) felt a lot of stress the previous day. Further, the report also found that 77% of employees are not engaged or actively disengaged at work.
While this doesn’t indicate that the employees are completely dysfunctional, it indicates that their level of proactivity and enthusiasm to contribute are low. Employees' emotional investment in the workplace is not enough to promote productivity or ensure the collective well-being of the workforce.
At the outset, this may seem like an alarming percentage of the workforce that doesn’t feel okay most of the time. However, the Deloitte survey also gives us a glimmer of hope—over 80% of the respondents said that mental health policies are an important indicator for them when considering an employer, and over 50% agreed that their employers’ efforts to focus on mental health have brought about positive change.
This indicates the next major trend in the workplace today: prioritizing employee engagement and mental well-being.
As the corporate world finds itself in an unprecedented position, it is an opportune moment for companies to unify the workforce, build mentally safe environments and connectedness and strengthen belonging by leading with purpose.
According to a Porter Novelli survey, over 90% of employees who work at companies with a strong sense of purpose say they’re more inspired, motivated and loyal. There are several ways to drive collective purpose in organizations, such as corporate donations, volunteering and employee-matching gift programs.
Volunteering, among these, comes equipped with the special power to not only create a sense of purpose but also act as a vehicle to engage the workforce meaningfully, build connectedness and communities within the organization and establish a sense of well-being.
Numerous studies have consistently highlighted the profound relationship between volunteering and enhanced mental health. Individuals who engage in volunteering regularly report lower levels of depression, greater life satisfaction and a heightened sense of purpose. And eight out of 10 employees believe that volunteering is essential to mental well-being, according to the Porter Novelli survey cited above.
As a global employee volunteering firm, Goodera, my company has seen a steady rise in the number of employee volunteering events organized by companies, with in-person events becoming more frequent and popular. Companies are using opportunities such as conferences, summits, anniversary celebrations and employee onboarding days to foster a sense of purpose and engagement among their workforce.
A great starting point to understand how employees are feeling is periodic, anonymous pulse-check surveys. These could involve asking them questions that range from the status of their mental well-being to how they feel among colleagues.
Identifying social leaders and encouraging them to foster a sense of belonging among their colleagues is a great next step. These social leaders can encourage employees to share their concerns, execute community-level activities and understand what causes matter to them.
HR and corporate social responsibility (CSR) departments can then align the causes that their employees care about with their organizations' business and ESG goals. The social leaders, with the backing of the CSR and HR departments, can gather and encourage employees to volunteer for these initiatives.
Volunteering can positively benefit the employee experience. According to Goodera's post-event surveys, 97.5% of the respondents agree they feel a greater sense of belonging to their organization after a volunteer event.
Volunteering is not a substitute for therapy or a solution for mental health illnesses, but it can be a critical tool in helping to prevent mental health issues and heal from them. It takes employees out of their comfort zones, helps them interact with those from other backgrounds and teams and enables engagement with outside communities. This busts biases, increases emotional intelligence and fosters a strong sense of warmth in company culture, ultimately contributing to a more mentally safe workplace.
Today, we spend more than half of our day at the workplace and, hence, half our lives among our colleagues. Therefore, it’s extremely important to feel "connected" and to live healthy lives. Corporate volunteering may be an important part of building such connections and the healthy workplaces of tomorrow.
