Saudi King Salman (R) and his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) have drawn some of the biggest names on Wall Street and tech to Riyadh for the kingdom's annual finance summit.
As Israel continued to bombard Gaza just two weeks after a devastating incursion of Hamas militants it was business as usual at a summit dubbed “Davos in the desert”, Saudi Arabia’s annual investment showcase. In attendance were a gallery of billionaires, Wall Street titans and tech hotshots like disgraced Uber founder Travis Kalanick and ousted WeWork CEO Adam Neumann, all of them drawn to the kingdom’s pot of gold — the $778 billion sovereign wealth fund.
Organizers of the Future Investment Initiative summit claim that only a handful of delegates canceled attending. The Saudi event has weathered worse in its short history — Western leaders, corporations and executives abandoned plans to attend in 2018 following the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The CIA later determined that the killing had been at the direction of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who appeared at the summit briefly.
Outside of headline speakers like JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon, and former White House envoy Jared Kushner, few delegates at the gathering in the Saudi capital Riyadh were keen to be named. As headlines from the war flashed overhead on screens, business leaders offered platitudes:. “There is a new S in ESG which is security,” warned Citi’s Jane Frazer at the event, swapping out the social in “Environmental, Social and Governance” investing. A few blocks away, outside the headquarters of the country’s Human Rights Commission, the word “Rights” blinked intermittently on the building’s massive illuminated sign.
Animated doves flashed overhead on electronic billboards as silver-clad dancers took to the stage to kick off the event, which was followed by a snippet of Puccini from a schoolboy opera singer. Later, a trio of robots would hold Q&As sessions and a poetry recital. And on Wednesday, Jared Kushner, who secured a $2 billion investment from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman just six months after leaving the Trump administration's White House, would opine on the Gaza war. “When the forces of good are winning, the forces of evil will try to stop them — and that’s what I really believe the terrorist attack was meant to do,” he said. “Israel’s economy was rocking in terms of all the different growth, it was a very attractive partner to a lot of people in the region and the progress between Saudi and Israel was progressing incredibly well.”
The war was a recurring talking point for the pundits in attendance. But the real business at the conference, which drew 6,000 business leaders, investors, and minor celebrities like Dr. Oz, were updates on Saudi Arabia’s massive experiment in breaking its economy’s reliance on oil.
Suitors crowded around staff from the sovereign wealth fund and its technology investment arm, Sanabil, but the booth manned by the agency promoting foreign investment into Saudi Arabia, and partially state-owned Aramco, which has largely funded the bonanza, was notably quieter.
The summit marked the halfway point in Mohammed bin Salman’s 14-year plan to remake the Kingdom’s economy by 2030. So-called “giga” projects like a $500 billion effort to build a futuristic city called Neom on the Red Sea are tentpoles of the plan that has also seen the kingdom become a major investor in golf, soccer, video gaming, and tech companies.
